                        WWW-TheEchoNest

The WWW-TheEchoNest modules allow for programatically interacting with
The Echo Nest's music intelligence API.

This module attempts to provide the key API calls as well as adding some
helper methods to provide accesss to items not currently exposed in other
Echo Nest wrapper modules. One example is simple accsss to rate limit
which is containted in the response header.

This module has several dependencies on other CPAN work, the most significant
of which is Moose.  While initial steps have been taken to make install less
painful attention to the install process has been the main focus for the
first few releases.

If you want to leverage the song identify features you will need to install
the codegen package available on github:
